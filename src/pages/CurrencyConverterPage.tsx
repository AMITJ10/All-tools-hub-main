          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <Accordion type="single" collapsible className="w-full">
            <AccordionItem value="item-1">
              <AccordionTrigger>How often are the exchange rates updated?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                The exchange rates are updated frequently throughout the day from our data provider, the European Central Bank (ECB). The "Last updated" timestamp shows when the current rate was fetched.
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem value="item-2">
              <AccordionTrigger>Are these the rates I will get from my bank?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Not necessarily. The rates shown here are mid-market rates, which are the midpoint between the buy and sell rates on the global currency markets. Banks and money transfer services typically add a markup to these rates. This tool is best used for estimation purposes.
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem value="item-3">
              <AccordionTrigger>What happens if the live rates cannot be fetched?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                If our tool cannot connect to the live rate service, it will attempt to use a cached rate from the last 24 hours to provide an estimate. A notification will appear to inform you that you are viewing a cached rate.
