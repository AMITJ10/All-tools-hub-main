            Understanding Your Loan EMI
          </h2>
          <p>
            An Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) is a fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. EMIs are used to pay off both interest and principal each month so that over a specified number of years, the loan is paid off in full. Our calculator helps you determine this monthly amount based on your loan principal, interest rate, and tenure.

              <AccordionTrigger>What is an amortization schedule?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                An amortization schedule is a table detailing each periodic payment on a loan. It shows how much of each payment is applied to interest and how much to the principal. Our calculator shows a preview for the first 12 months.

            <AccordionItem value="item-2">
              <AccordionTrigger>How does loan tenure affect my EMI?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                A longer loan tenure results in a lower monthly EMI but increases the total interest you pay over the loan's duration. Conversely, a shorter tenure increases your EMI but reduces the total interest paid.
